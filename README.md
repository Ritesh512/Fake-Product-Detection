## Project Title - Fake Product Detection Using Blockchain
```
This application has the ability to identify counterfeit products in the market and predict their appearance.
The product's manufacturer must register the product on the website in order for it to generate a unique QR
code that can be used to trace the product all the way through the supply chain.
Ownership of the product may be transferred by the product owner.
Therefore, after transferring ownership, he is unable to offer the same goods to another client.
Additionally, if the QR code is scanned later, the new address of the recipient of the ownership transfer will be displayed. In this way, the supply chain is likewise unaffected
by the duplicate QR code.
The application is build using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MYSQL, Web3.js, Solidity, MetaMask, Ganache.
```
## Features
```
1. **Product Registration:**
   - Manufacturers register their products on the website, generating a unique QR code for each product.

2. **Supply Chain Tracking:**
   - The unique QR code facilitates tracking of the product throughout the supply chain, from manufacturing to end-user.

3. **Ownership Transfer:**
   - Product owners can transfer ownership of their products through the application.

4. **Ownership History:**
   - The system maintains a transparent ownership history for each product, preventing resale to multiple customers.

5. **QR Code Authentication:**
   - QR code scanning verifies the authenticity of the product and provides information about the current owner.

6. **Registration/Login Types**
   - Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer and Customer 
```

## Usage
```
1. **Product Registration:**
   - Manufacturers visit the website and register their products, receiving a unique QR code for each.

2. **Supply Chain Tracking:**
   - Throughout the supply chain, participants scan the QR code to update the product's location and status.

3. **Ownership Transfer:**
   - Product owners initiate ownership transfer through the application, updating the database.

4. **QR Code Authentication:**
   - Consumers can scan the QR code to verify the authenticity of the product and view its ownership history.
